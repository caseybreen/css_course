This is the repository for the "Topics in Computational Social Science" course. 


**Description:** The growing availability of new streams of data, expansion of computational power and the digitalisation of our lives has created new questions and research opportunities for social and population scientists. The course will introduce students to a range of methodological and substantive topics in computational social science. We will cover topics such as digital trace and big data, machine learning, non-probability sampling, social networks, and agent-based modelling and microsimulation. The course will consist of seminar and lab sessions (taught in R), where students will engage with research in computational social science and learn to apply basic computational methods to research problems based on existing research papers.

The lab exercises are given below:
